                        India's semiconductor component market will see its cumulative revenues climb to $300 billion during 2021-2026,
                        a report said Tuesday. The ‘India Semiconductor Market Report, 2019-2026',
                        a joint research by the India Electronics & Semiconductor Association (IESA) and Counterpoint Research,
                        observed that India is poised to be the second largest market in the world in terms of scale and growing demand for
                        semiconductor components across several industries and applications.
                        It added that this was being bolstered by the increasing pace of digital transformation and the adoption of
                        new technologies and covers smartphones, PCs, wearables, cloud data centers,
                        Industry 4.0 applications, IoT, smart mobility, and advanced telecom and public utility infrastructure.
                        “While the country is becoming one of the largest consumers of electronic and semiconductor components,
                        most components are imported, offering limited economic opportunities for the country.
                        Currently, only 9% of this semiconductor requirement is met locally,” the report said.
                        it noted that India's end equipment market in 2021 stood at $119 billion in terms of revenue and
                        is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19% from 2021 to 2026.
                        It said that the Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector in India will play a major role in the
                        country's overall growth, from sourcing components to design manufacturing.
                        “Before the end of this decade, there will be nothing that will not be touched by electronics and the ubiquitous ‘chip,
                        '” IESA CEO Krishna Moorthy said. “Be it fighting carbon emissions, renewable energy, food safety, or healthcare,
                        the semiconductor chip will be all-pervasive.""",  # noqa: E501
                    """
                        Counterpoint Research vice president Neil Shah added that consumption will not only come from the advanced
                        semiconductor-heavy 5G and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network infrastructure equipment,
                        which will contribute to more than 14% of the total semiconductor consumption in 2026,
                        but also from the highly capable AI-driven 5G endpoints,
                        from smartphones, tablets, PCs, connected cars, industrial robotics to private networks.
                        “The telecom sector with the advent of 5G and fiber network rollout will be a key catalyst in boosting
                        the semiconductor components consumption,” Shah said.
                        “Also, ongoing efforts to embrace cleaner and greener vehicles (electric vehicles) will provide an impetus for
                        the automobile industry to adopt advanced technologies,
                        which in turn will boost the demand for semiconductor components in India.”
                        He also believed that consumer electronics, industrial, and mobile and wearables will be the other key industries
                        for the growth of the semiconductor market in India.
                        Further, this semiconductor demand will not only be driven by domestic consumption but also by the growing share of exports.
                        Mobile and wearables,
                        IT and industrial sectors alone contributed to almost 80% of the semiconductor revenues in India in 2021, the research found.
                        Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint Research, said the gradual shift from feature phones to smartphones
                        has been generating increased proportions of advanced logic processors, memory, integrated controllers, sensors and
                        other components. “This will continue to drive the value of the semiconductor content in smartphones, which is still an
                        under-penetrated segment in India, aided by the rise of wearables such as smartwatch and TWS,” he said.""",  # noqa: E501

                        Over the past decades, my research team has summarized its scientific insights in nearly a thousand publications. But despite
                        the large volume of documented thoughts, I hereby confess that I remain puzzled about the three astronomical aspects of our lives.
                        First, consider the composition of the material. Our bodies are made of heavy elements grouped together in the cores of large
                        stars, which explode to enrich the interstellar medium, where the Solar system is formed, where the Earth thickens and nourishes
                        our temporary existence. Viewed this way, we were just passengers in a spaceborn cabin called Earth with borrowed luggage,
                        heading to an unknown destination. Despite our basic ignorance, we pride ourselves on peripheral knowledge.
                        For example, we recognize that most objects in the universe have a different nature than the object we see in our cosmic
                        neighborhood. We label it “dark matter” or “dark energy” and count how much it is up to the second decimal place.
                        But a century of famous cosmology without understanding the nature of most of the things that make up the universe, is a sad
                        record of scientific knowledge.  Second, consider the time. Our individual lifespan is limited to a period of time at least one
                        hundred million times shorter than the age of the Universe. This allows us to experience only a brief snapshot of cosmic history
                        and limits our perspective on the big picture. Astronomy benefits greatly from billions of years of documented data. """,  # noqa: E501

These include the integration of semiconductors in clean vehicles, which demonstrates the commitment to sustainable practices and technology adoption. Water conservation techniques showcase proactive measures to manage natural resources prudently, while the acknowledgment of climate change's role in exacerbating extreme weather conditions highlights the environmental risks businesses face. The employment of fluorophores for environmental monitoring is indicative of emerging tools for ecological assessment. On the social dimension, the focus is on public health and disease prevention, which is integral to the ESG's social pillar. Finally, the mention of fermentation in gardening signals a nod towards innovative yet sustainable agricultural practices. While other articles seem less connected to ESG, the collected insights point towards a sector grappling with environmental challenges and social responsibilities, aiming to adopt best practices in both realms.",  # noqa: E501

            "Summary": "The recent diaspora of global developments encapsulates technological progress, environmental challenges, and socio-political concerns. India's semiconductor market is on an upsurge, paralleled by a global emphasis on water conservation amid climate change. As Taiwan braces for a typhoon, Germany and Italy underscore the vital need for meteorological foresight. Scientific curiosity probes both the microcosm, in advances in fluorescence and skin care tech, and the macrocosm, through unveiling cosmic mysteries and pursuing lunar exploration. Marine biology and botany burgeon, driven by patents and public interest, while health and security issues engender responses to mosquito-borne diseases, drug trafficking, and airspace violations. Collectively, these snapshots from diverse fields illustrate an era marked by an adaptive humanity as it navigates a balance between exploiting and conserving its natural and intellectual resources.",  # noqa: E501
