# Entity linking

This project requires no model artifact, but local development **does** require artifacts of
dependency services
- `ner` and
- `entity-fishing`.

For details on how to run and maintain the `entity-linking` project components, please refer to
- [the project README](../README.md) and
- [the project docs.](../docs/)

Please find this project documentation [here](https://onclusive.atlassian.net/l/cp/eEDCtrZm).
