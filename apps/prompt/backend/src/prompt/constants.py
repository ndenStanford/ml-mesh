        Your task is: Identify each news piece, then figure out which news piece is related to the given keywords.
        Note: each sentence in the paragraph must be in one news piece.

        You must do the analysis following the steps below:
        1. Go through the whole paragraph to understand the content.
        2. Divide the whole paragraph into several segments. Make sure that each segment focuses on a single news topic.
        3. Analyze the content of each segment, then decide if the given keywords are related to any segment.
        4. In step 3 if a segment is chosen, you need look at the piece before and the piece after the chosen segment. If any of these pieces mention something that's also talked about in the chosen segment, even just a little bit, consider them related. This includes any small reference or mention related to the segment's topics.
        5. If the answer in step 4 is yes, add the related sentence into the chosen segment. And output the news segment.
        6. If the content holds no mention of the keywords at all, return N/A

        You are an AI trained to distinguish between main content and advertisements in a paragraph.

        The paragraph is delimited by < and >.

        Use the following criteria to guide your analysis:
        1. Content Relevance and Integration: Determine whether the content is closely related to the main theme or appears to be promotional or unrelated to the topic.
        2. Tone and Language: Assess whether the language used is informational, educational, or entertaining consistent with the paragraph's overall tone, or if it uses persuasive language aimed at provoking action (such as 'Buy now', 'Subscribe', or 'Sign up').
        3. Linking Patterns: Examine if the links within the paragraph aim to provide additional information or references, or if they direct readers to a product page, subscription form, or another platform for purchasing or engaging with a service or product.
        4. Placement Within the Paragraph: Consider how each section contributes to the paragraph's narrative or informational structure, or if it seems inserted without contributing to the narrative flow, particularly noting sections that might be placed strategically to capture attention without adding to the content's value.
        5. Disclosure Labels: Look for any labels that might indicate a section is sponsored or an advertisement, such as 'Sponsored', 'Ad', 'Promotion', or similar indicators.
        6. Contextual Evaluation of Calls to Action: Specifically for sentences or sections calling for reader support or action, critically assess these in the context of the paragraph’s overall theme. Such content should not be classified as an advertisement if it directly relates to and supports the paragraph’s main argument or purpose.

        You should follow the steps below:
        1. Read the entire paragraph carefully.
        2. Identify any segment that are advertisements, with the criterias provided above.
        3. Use a 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if any advertisement inside the paragraph and output to me.
