&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Autism''' is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Land2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Landa RJ |title= Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life |journal= Nat Clin Pract Neurol | volume= 4 |issue=3 |pages=138–147 |year=2008 |pmid= 18253102 |doi= 10.1038/ncpneuro0731 | doi-access= free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{vcite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Autism Spectrum Disorder, 299.00 (F84.0) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pagex = 50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; These signs often develop gradually, though some autistic children experience [[Regressive autism|regression]] in their communication and social skills after reaching [[developmental milestones]] at a normal pace.&lt;ref name=Stef2008&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Stefanatos GA | s2cid = 34658024 | title = Regression in autistic spectrum disorders | journal = Neuropsychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 305–319 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18956241 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9073-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Several interventions have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve the ability of autistic people to function and participate independently in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=CDC|date=23 September 2019|title=Treatment {{!}} Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/treatment.html|access-date=8 April 2021|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral, psychological, education, and/or skill-building interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently, as well as other social, communication, and language skills.

==Causes==
{{Main|Causes of autism}}

It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fractionable&quot;/&gt; However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fractionable&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Happé F, Ronald A |s2cid=13928876 |title=The 'fractionable autism triad': a review of evidence from behavioural, genetic, cognitive and neural research |journal=[[Neuropsychol Rev]] |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=287–304 |year=2008 |pmid=18956240 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Happé F, Ronald A, Plomin R | title = Time to give up on a single explanation for autism | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 1218–1220 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17001340 | doi = 10.1038/nn1770 | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leo-Kanner.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Balding man in his early 60s in coat and tie, with a serious but slightly smiling expression|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–1317 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans-title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanner1943&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–250 |year=1943| issue = 4 | pmid = 4880460}} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title = Autistic disturbances of affective contact | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–136 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot;/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | s2cid = 38130758 | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–2023 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
