An '''acropolis''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἀκρόπολις, [[Romanization of Ancient Greek|tr.]] ''Akrópolis''; from ''ákros'' (άκρος) or ''ákron'' (άκρον) "highest, topmost, outermost" and ''pólis'' "city"; plural in English: ''acropoles'', ''acropoleis'' or ''acropolises'') is a [[Human settlement|settlement]], especially a [[citadel]], built upon an area of elevated ground—frequently a hill with [[precipice|precipitous]] sides, chosen for purposes of defense. In many parts of the world, acropoleis became the nuclei of large cities of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[ancient Rome]], and for this reason they are sometimes prominent landmarks in modern cities with ancient pasts, such as modern [[Rome]]. The word ''acropolis'' literally means in Greek "upper city," and though associated primarily with the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Athens]], [[Argos]] ( with [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]]), [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] (with [[Cadmea]]), and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] (with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]] in [[Edinburgh]]. An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]]. Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban [[Castro culture]] settlements located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops. The most famous example is the [[Acropolis of Athens]], which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the [[Parthenon]]), is known without qualification as ''the Acropolis''. Although originating in the mainland of Greece, use of the acropolis model quickly spread to Greek colonies such as the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[Lato]] on [[Crete]] during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]]. Because of its classical [[Hellenistic]] style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano's]] Great Stone Church in [[California|California, United States]] has been called the "American Acropolis". Other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or [[alcázar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|communes]] still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as ''La Rocca'' of the commune. The term ''acropolis'' is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya city|Maya cities]], including [[Tikal]] and [[Copán]].
