The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, termed an [[antigen]]. Each tip of the \"Y\" of an antibody contains a (a structure analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular [[epitope]] (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can ''tag'' a [[microbe]] or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). The production of antibodies is the main function of the [[humoral immune system]].",

Physiological tolerance also occurs when an organism builds up a resistance to the effects of a substance after repeated exposure.
