Titer testing employs [[serial dilution]] to obtain approximate quantitative information from an analytical procedure that inherently only evaluates as positive or negative. The titer corresponds to the highest dilution factor that still yields a positive reading. For example, positive readings in the first 8 serial twofold dilutions translate into a titer of (i.e, 2−8). A specific example is a '''viral titer''', which is the lowest concentration of [[virus]] that still infects cells. To determine the titer, several dilutions are prepared, such as 10−1, 10−2, 10−3,...,10−8.",

              "definition": "'''Gene expression''' is the process by which information from a [[gene]] is used in the synthesis of a functional [[gene product]]. These products are often [[protein]]s, but in non-protein coding genes such as [[rRNA|ribosomal RNA (rRNA)]], [[tRNA|transfer RNA (tRNA)]] or [[snRNA|Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)]] genes, the product is a functional [[RNA]]. The process of gene expression is used by all known life - [[eukaryotes]] (including [[multicellular organisms]]), [[prokaryotes]] ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), possibly induced by [[virus]]es - to generate the [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] machinery for life. Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[RNA splicing]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], and [[post-translational modification]] of a protein. [[Regulation of gene expression|Gene regulation]] gives the [[cell (biology)|cell]] control over structure and function, and is the basis for [[cellular differentiation]], [[morphogenesis]] and the versatility and [[adaptability]] of any [[organism]]. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism.",
