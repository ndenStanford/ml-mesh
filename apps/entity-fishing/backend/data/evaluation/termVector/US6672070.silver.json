Aerodynamics is a subfield of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], with much theory shared between them. Aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the difference being that gas dynamics applies to all gases. Understanding the motion of air (often called a flow field) around an object enables the calculation of forces and moments acting on the object. Typical properties calculated for a flow field include [[velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]] and [[temperature]] as a function of position and time. By defining a [[control volume]] around the flow field, equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy can be defined and used to solve for the properties. The use of aerodynamics through [[mathematical]] analysis, empirical approximations, [[wind tunnel]] experimentation, and [[computer simulation]]s form the scientific basis for [[heavier than air flight|heavier-than-air flight]].",
