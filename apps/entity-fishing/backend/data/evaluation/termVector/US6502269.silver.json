A pool can be built either above or in the ground, and from materials such as concrete (also known as gunite), [[metal]], [[plastic]] or [[fiberglass]]. The innovation of a composite construction of fibreglass, with an epoxy coating and porcelain ceramic tiles has led to the Pre-form, Composite-type with significant advantages over older methods; however, it also has increased sensitivity to metal staining.",

The velocity achieved by the impeller transfers into pressure when the outward movement of the fluid is confined by the pump casing. Impellers are usually short cylinders with an open inlet (called an eye) to accept incoming fluid, vanes to push the [[fluid]] radially, and a splined, keyed or threaded bore to accept a drive-shaft.",
