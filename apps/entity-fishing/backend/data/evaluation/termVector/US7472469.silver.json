The bending is via [[hammer]]ing (manual or powered) or via [[press brake]]s and similar tools. The assembling (joining of the pieces) is via [[welding]], binding with [[adhesive]]s, [[rivet]]ing, [[screw|threaded fasteners]], or even yet more bending in the form of a crimped seam. [[Structural steel]] and [[sheet metal]] are the usual starting materials for fabrication, along with the welding wire, flux, and fasteners that will join the cut pieces.
