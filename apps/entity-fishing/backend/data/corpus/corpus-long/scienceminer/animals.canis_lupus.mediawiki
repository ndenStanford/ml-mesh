Multiple Character Analysis of [[Gray wolf|Canis lupus]], [[Coyote|latrans]], and [[Dog|familiaris]], With a Discussion of the [[Correlation and dependence|Relationships]] of [[Red wolf|Canis niger]]

A multiple character analysis was undertaken of a broadly representative [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of three [[Species|species]]: [[Gray wolf|Cants lupus]] ([[Gray wolf|wolf]]), [[Coyote|C. latrans]] ([[Coyote|coyote]]), and [[Dog|C. familiaris]] ([[Dog|dog]]). These [[Species|species]] are clearly and siirnificantly distinguished by the technique of [[Linear discriminant analysis|linear discrimination]]. The analysis provides a basis for the identification of [[Skull|skulls]] not obviously distinguishable by size or other diagnostic characters.

Early [[Population|populations]] of [[Red wolf|Canis n. niger]] and [[Gregory's wolf|C. n. gregoryi]] ([[Red wolf|red wolf]]) are compared with the three [[Species|species]] above and are found to form a [[Cluster sampling|cluster]] with [[Gray wolf|lupus]] and to be sharply distinct from the other two [[Species|species]]. Additional comparisons show that while [[Eastern wolf|lupus lycaon]] and [[Red wolf|niger]] both overlap with [[Gray wolf|lupus]], they are distinct from each other. This entire [[Cluster sampling|cluster]] is quite distinct from [[Coyote|latrans]], with [[Red wolf|niger]] being the farthest removed. A [[Sample (statistics)||sample population]] of [[Gregory's wolf|C. n. gregoiyi]], from the edge of the extending range of [[Coyote|C. latrans]], was examined and found to show too great a range of variation to be attributed to a single [[Species|species]].
