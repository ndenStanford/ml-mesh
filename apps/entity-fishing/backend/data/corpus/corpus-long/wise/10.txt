Getting ready for a trip through China, especially planning anything outside major cities like Shanghai and Nanjing, is unlike planning a trip elsewhere. The usual sources ¡ª guidebooks, Web searches, user review sites ¡ª either don¡¯t provide the information you need or are in Chinese. Compared with, say, Southeast Asia, China has not been overrun, and thus well-documented, by independent travelers.
So what should you do? First, learn how to use Google Translate. It works and is cheap to use, even if you have to turn on international roaming. Second, get a phrase book in which key phrases are written out in large-font Chinese characters. (Don¡¯t count on your Mandarin pronunciation.) Third, learn how to count from 1 to 10 on (mostly) one hand as the Chinese do: this is how prices will be relayed you. (Online videos can help.)
Fourth, familiarize yourself with the English pages of Elong.com and Ctrip.com, China-based online travel agencies, where you can find endless English-language listings for cheap Chinese hotels. I usually paid about $20 a night.
